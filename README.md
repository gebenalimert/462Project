Unfortunately, Spotify API stopped sharing the song features that we were using in our project. Thus, data retrieval part cannot be reproduced.
But, using the dataset we fetched before and the added data we found online, all other parts can be tested.
To run the code:
1. Install Python to your machine.
2. Install necessary libraries such as cvxopt, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, mpl_toolkits.<br />
```
pip install cvxopt pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn scipy mpl_toolkits
````
3. Make sure you have our dataset file in the directory that you have the code files and will run the code, 'aaa.csv'.
4. All files are independent of each other. You can run any of them.
5. Some files require changes in the code to test different classes (1, 2, 3). Necessary changes are noted as a command line at those files.
